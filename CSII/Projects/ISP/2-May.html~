  <h1>What was our plan by the end of the week?</h1>
  <p>Our plan was to add some new buttons and make them functionable to the app as well as fix the padding of some styling of the Time Managment App. </p>
  
  <h1>The Github Issues,(Feature, Bug, Other Task)?</h1>
  <p>We got 2 new Github Issue, a enhancement issue for the Assignemnt List. A feature where assignments are shown next to the calendar for easy viewing by the user. will include their name and due date, and whatever else is added. The last one Github Issue was the Help Page/FeedBack Page .</p>
  
  <h1>What do I have to achieve and how to achieve it?</h1>
  <p>My plan is to make a button to go back to the homepage when they need to from the Calendar time manaement page creating an anchor tag that is a button, and make it link. And create a button, that will delete the assignemtns created if the peoiple want to delete the assignemnt they created when they add the assignemtn</p>
