  <h1>What was our plan by the end of the week?</h1>
  <p>Our plan was to make a calendar icon show up in the top left corner of our screen of all of our 5 pages. These 5 pages are on the right side of the screen with different info. We then make the title of the page show different Titles of the page rather than one name of the title. EX: About not all the time, it varies between Home, Methods, About, Feedback and Help, pages. </p>
  
  <h1>The Github Issues,(Feature, Bug, Other Task)?</h1>
  <p>None for this weekend in github issues, but we have problem with adjusting the style of the app of the last commit, but it shows the old styles. In other words 2 of our computers show the good background and title, and the other 2 show the old background commit which is kind of concerning considering we tried doing a git pull too.</p>
  
  <h1>What do I have to achieve and how to achieve it?</h1>
  <p>My plan is to make an icon show up in the browser on all files, by using SFTP to upload the file and then github to manually upload the file in Github. Make sure that the image, calendar.png is in the browswer when we finish. .</p>
